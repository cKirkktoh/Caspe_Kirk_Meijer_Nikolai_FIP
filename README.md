# Quatro Rebrand by Nikolai Meijer and Kirk Caspe

Quatro is back! A blast from the past, this drink from the 80's is here to blow your minds. The brand isn't the only thing refreshed, you will be too when you have a sip and lay your eyes on our beautiful new appearance. But that's not all that has changed... We have developed four unique new flavours with stunning colours and graphics to match. 

The goal of this website is to sell the most Quatro we possibly can, and to provide users on all platforms and devices a seamless and comfortable experience. Users will be able to find anything they need on our site with ease.

There were a few bumps along the way, but it is finally complete and we look ofrward to sharing Quatro's new and improved website and brand with you and our customers!

## Plan

Start with the basics: use files and resources given in class, build a structure, and start branding.

Apply branding and styling to website.

Develop advanced 3D and vector graphics.

Finalize by bringing it all together into one complete site.

## Usage
